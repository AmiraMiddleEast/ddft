## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

-

- [Phase 01]: Use shadcn CLI v4.3 --defaults preset (base-nova) then relabel style to new-york in components.json — the old --style/--base-color flags were removed in shadcn 4.3
- [Phase 01]: Drop shadcn's auto-added Geist Google font; UI-SPEC mandates system font stack in Phase 1
- [Phase 01]: Pin better-sqlite3@12.9.0, drizzle-orm@0.45.2, drizzle-kit@0.31.10 at exact versions (no caret) for reproducible builds
- [Phase 01]: DB client uses path.resolve(process.cwd(), DATABASE_URL) to mitigate cwd-dependent path breakage (P-04) across dev/build/test contexts
- [Phase 01]: Enable journal_mode = WAL and foreign_keys = ON on every connection open (SQLite defaults FK enforcement OFF)
- [Phase 01]: Keep db/schema.ts as placeholder (export {}) — Plan 03 overwrites via better-auth CLI; hand-writing the auth schema is an anti-pattern (P-06)
